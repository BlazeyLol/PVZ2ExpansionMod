# **Expansion Mod for PvZ2**

# Credits

* Vi - code assistance
* Brekko/Jay - original repositories
* Snowie - helping me with this

# What is this?

It's my own library for PvZ2. I want it to be fully open sourced and public. My main goal is to softcode and expand vanilla entities via reflection system, which adds new properties to packages. It's currently in development, and no ARM64 version is available at the moment.

# Current Features
* IntegerID backport! - Plant/Zombie types now support id mapping, which will help modders who dont want to constantly update the apk.
* Power Lily softcode - Power Lily gained new properties regarding her collectable
* Mummy Memory and Piano List from the original Example Mod

# Future Plans
I want to take care of more plants/zombies like grinderhead, bull, camels, ra, arcade pusher and tomb raiser.
I am also working on a new Board zoom system, that doesn't require modifying Grid's size.
